# Synopsis
A Data Visualization project of the average cost of a house in the US vs the average wage index of a citizen in the US, alongside the interest rate a 30-year fixed mortgage

# Design Process
All source code was programmed in Python 3.11, using matplotlib and pandas libraries.

All data from the sources provided below were inputted by hand into one collective .CSV file. The ASPUS yearly prices were found by calculating the average price across all four quarters of each year. (e.g. [Q1-1990 + Q2-1990 + Q3-1990 + Q4-1990] / 4)
